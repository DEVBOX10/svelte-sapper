If you don&#39;t have a strong reason to prefer one over the other, we&#39;d recommend using the Rollup template. The Rollup implementation supports additional features such as improved tree-shaking for smaller bundles, TypeScript, the ability to <a href=\"../docs#Browser_support\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">serve a legacy bundle to older browsers</a>, and it automatically lists all your <code>.js</code> and <code>.css</code> files in the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><code>Link</code> header</a> to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/preload\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">preload</a> those files.</p>\n","metadata":{"question":"Should I use Webpack or Rollup with Sapper?"}},{"fragment":"typescript","answer":"<p>The Sapper template project with Rollup (see <a href=\"/docs#Getting_started\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Getting started</a>) can be converted to TypeScript by running:</p>\n<pre class='language-bash'><code>node scripts/setupTypeScript.js</code></pre><p>You can also find a number of <a href=\"https://github.com/sveltejs/integrations#sapper-templates-boilerplates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">community templates</a> that utilize TypeScript.</p>\n","metadata":{"question":"How do I use TypeScript with Sapper?"}},{"fragment":"why-is-there-a-node_modules-folder-in-src","answer":"<p>Before bundling your app, Sapper builds a special package for your app, which you can access by importing from <code>@sapper/app</code>.
